# Workshop_on_GIT_and_GitHub
This is a workshop that i attended which was conducted by an industry professional. In this i have learnt about what is git and why is it used. I have also understood about what a version is and what exactly is version control and then about version control basic CLI commands. Later in the workshop i also learnt about git settings.
